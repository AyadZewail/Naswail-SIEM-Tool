Block unauthorized network connections
Allow traffic only from trusted sources
Restrict inbound requests on vulnerable ports
Filter outgoing traffic to suspicious domains
Deny access from unknown devices
Prevent unauthenticated API calls
Blacklist known malicious IP ranges
Revoke access for compromised accounts
Apply rate-limiting on network
Limiting bandwidth helps with attacks
limit the number of incoming requests
rate limiting sets a maximum threshold on the number of requests that can be processed per second
rate-limiting incoming connection requests is a crucial strategy to prevent attacks
Use Response Rate Limiting to restrict the amount of traffic
restricting the number of incoming requests from a given IP address may prevent attacks
