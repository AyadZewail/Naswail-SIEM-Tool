# Naiswail Network Traffic Analysis Tool

## Installation Guide

### Prerequisites
This software runs **only on Windows**. Before using it, you must install **Npcap**:

1. Download the **Npcap Installer** from [https://npcap.com/](https://npcap.com/).
2. Run the installer and follow the on-screen instructions.
3.Python  interpreter 3.13.0(newer version may or may not work)
4.Download the whole Repository and extract it
5.Use visual studio code(optional but prefered)

### Required Python Libraries
Ensure you have Python installed, then open a terminal (Command Prompt or PowerShell) and run the following command to install the necessary dependencies:

```sh
pip install numpy pandas psutil ipaddress scapy matplotlib networkx PyQt6 statistics scikit-learn plotly geoip2 folium bs4

```

## Usage Instructions

### Running the Application
1. Ensure **Npcap** is installed.
2.make sure to extract the GeoLite2.rar and copy the file inside it into the directory(next to naswail_main,naswail_tools etc) as otherwise the map won't show
3. Run the script using Python.
4.preferably on visual studio code(optional).

### Packet Capture:
#Packet Export
- Click **Start Capture** to begin capturing packets(you will now if it is currently capturing based on the fact that the time intervel will become highlighted in red).
- Click **Stop Capture** to halt the capture process.
- Click **Export** in the file tab which is on the top left to save the captured packets.
# Packet Import
-Click on the file tab(on the top left corner) and click on import then pick your pcap file
-The packets will not instantly load rather they will be rendred sequentially for performance reasons,eventually it will stop rendering packets indicating that the whole pcap has been loaded.
#live capture
-Click on the live capture opton in the file tap to return back to live capture



### Visualization
- To generate charts related to sensors, you must first create one or more sensors.
- After creating sensors in **Sensor Tab** and click **Focus On**.

## Features Overview
- **Real-time Packet Capture**: Captures live network traffic.
- **PCAP File Support**: Import and analyze stored capture files.
- **Advanced Filtering**: Filter packets by protocol, IP, port, and time.
- **Machine Learning-Based Anomaly Detection**: Uses **Random Forest** for detecting anomalies.
- **Network Traffic Prediction**: Uses **Linear Regression** to forecast traffic trends(note that it is not instant you must wait for a few seconds before it generates the predication).
- **3D Network Topology Visualization**: Displays network structure interactively,pererd to ping devices directly as to see imediate results for new devices.
- **Geolocation-Based Traffic Analysis**: Maps IP-based geolocations.
- **Network Activity detection:informs the user if a device brows a website or performs an http request
- **Corrupt Packet Detection**: Identifies and flags corrupted packets.
- **Custom Sensor System**: Allows user-defined monitoring points.
- **Comprehensive Graphs**: Generates pie charts, histograms, time series plots, and heatmaps.
- **and more.
