https://notes.networklessons.com/ping-possible-ping-responses,"When a host sends out aPingto another host, the target host either responds successfully, or returns some error code that further explains the failure.  There are severalcommon reasons for a ping to fail.  Understanding those responses is important in the troubleshooting process.
ICMPis the protocol used by ping and an echo requestcan have various responses.  These responses appear in a particular way depending upon the platform and operating system you are using.
On Cisco IOS, you may have any one of the following responses:
On a Windows device, you will typically have one of the following responses:
Typically, the corresponding responses on a Linux device are similar to the following:"
https://bluegoatcyber.com/blog/defending-against-ping-icmp-attacks/,"Ping (ICMP) attacks are a common form of cyber threat that can have serious consequences for individuals and businesses alike. In this article, we will explore the nature of these attacks, their potential damage, and, most importantly, how to defend against them. Understanding the basics of ping attacks and implementing preventive measures can significantlyenhance your network securityand protect yourself from potential threats.
The first step in defending against ping attacks is understanding what they are and how they work. Ping, or the Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) is a network utility that tests the connectivity between two devices. It sends an echo request message to the target device and waits for a reply. While typically used for diagnostic purposes, ICMP can also be exploited by malicious actors to launch attacks.
At its core, a ping (ICMP) attack floods a target device with ICMP echo request messages, overwhelming its resources and causing it to slow down or even crash. By repeatedly sending large volumes of pings, attackers can consume bandwidth, disrupt network operations, and disrupt legitimate traffic.
When an ICMP echo request message is sent to a target device, it expects a corresponding ICMP echo reply message. However, in a ping attack, the attacker may spoof the source IP address, making it difficult for the target device to send the reply to the correct destination. This can lead to further disruption and confusion in the network.
One common type of ICMP attack is the “Ping of Death,” where the attacker sends oversized ICMP packets to the target device. These oversized packets can cause buffer overflows, leading to system crashes or vulnerabilities that can be exploited for unauthorized access.
The potential damage caused by ICMP attacks can be significant. In addition to disrupting network operations, these attacks can be used as a smokescreen for othermalicious activities, such as data theft or unauthorized access. Furthermore, prolonged ping attacks can cause hardware failure, resulting in costly repairs and downtime.
ICMP attacks can also have cascading effects on other network devices. For example, if a target device becomes overwhelmed with ICMP traffic, it may start dropping legitimate packets, affecting the overall performance and reliability of the network. This can lead to frustrated users, decreased productivity, and potential business financial losses.
Defending against ICMP attacks requires a multi-layered approach. Network administrators can implement traffic filtering rules to block suspicious ICMP traffic and limit the impact of such attacks. Intrusion detection and prevention systems can also be deployed to detect and mitigate ICMP attacks in real-time.
Furthermore, network monitoring tools can help identify unusual patterns of ICMP traffic, allowing administrators to take proactive measures to prevent or mitigate potential attacks. Regular software updates and patches should also be applied to network devices to address any known vulnerabilities that ICMP attacks could exploit.
By understanding the basics of ICMP attacks and implementing appropriate security measures, organizations can better protect their networks and minimize the potential damage caused by these malicious activities.
To defend against ping attacks effectively, it is important to understand how they work and the techniques that attackers commonly employ.
A ping attack, also known as an ICMP flood attack, is a type of cyber attack that aims to overwhelm a target’s network by flooding it with ICMP echo requests. These requests are typically sent from a botnet, which is a network of compromised devices controlled by the attacker.
Ping attacks typically involve the use of botnets, which are networks of compromised devices controlled by the attacker. The attacker sends commands to these devices, instructing them to flood a target with ICMP echo requests. By distributing the attack across multiple devices, the attacker can amplify its impact, making it more difficult to mitigate.
When a device receives an ICMP echo request, it responds with an ICMP echo reply. In a ping attack, the attacker sends a large number of these requests to the target, overwhelming its network capacity and causing it to slow down or even crash. This can result in service disruptions, loss of data, and financial losses for the target.
One of the reasons why ping attacks are so effective is because ICMP traffic is typically allowed by default on most networks. This means that attackers can easily exploit this protocol to launch their attacks without being detected.
There are several common techniques that attackers use to enhance the effectiveness of their ping attacks. These include IP spoofing, where the attacker disguises their true IP address, and fragmentation, where the attack traffic is split into smaller packets to bypass network defenses.
IP spoofing is a technique that allows attackers to send ICMP echo requests with a forged source IP address. By doing this, the attacker can make it appear as if the requests are coming from a legitimate source, making it more difficult for network administrators to identify and block the attack.
Fragmentation is another technique commonly used in ping attacks. By splitting the attack traffic into smaller packets, the attacker can evade detection by network defenses that are designed to block large packets. This technique allows the attacker to bypass security measures and successfully flood the target’s network with ICMP echo requests.
In addition to IP spoofing and fragmentation, attackers may also use other techniques such as amplification and reflection to increase the impact of their ping attacks. Amplification involves exploiting vulnerabilities in certain network protocols to generate a larger response from the target, effectively amplifying the attack. Reflection attacks, on the other hand, involve using third-party servers to bounce the attack traffic off them, making it harder to trace the source of the attack.
Overall, ping attacks are a serious threat to network security and can cause significant damage if not properly defended against. Understanding the anatomy of these attacks and the techniques used by attackers is crucial in developing effective defense strategies.
Recognizing the signs of a potential ping attack is crucial for prompt detection and response. By monitoring your network and being vigilant for suspicious activity, you can minimize the damage caused by these attacks.
A ping attack, also known as an ICMP flood attack, is a type of Denial of Service (DoS) attack that targets network devices by overwhelming them with a large volume of Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) packets. These packets are typically used for network diagnostics, but attackers can exploit them to disrupt network operations.
Now, let’s dive deeper into the signs that may indicate a potential ping attack:
Some common signs that your network may be experiencing a ping attack include sudden network congestion, increased latency, and unresponsiveness of critical devices. When a ping attack occurs, the targeted devices become overwhelmed with ICMP packets, causing a significant increase in network traffic. This sudden surge in traffic can lead to congestion, resulting in slow network performance and increased latency.
In addition to network congestion and increased latency, unresponsiveness of critical devices is another red flag. During a ping attack, the targeted devices may become overloaded, causing them to freeze or become unresponsive. This can have severe consequences, especially if the affected devices are crucial for the operation of your network.
Another sign to watch out for is an increase in incoming ICMP traffic. ICMP packets are used for various network diagnostic purposes, such as ping requests and error reporting. However, during a ping attack, the volume of incoming ICMP traffic may skyrocket. Monitoring your network traffic and observing a sudden surge in ICMP packets can indicate an ongoing attack.
Various network security tools can be deployed to aid in the detection of ICMP attacks. Intrusion detection systems (IDS) and intrusion prevention systems (IPS) are commonly used to monitor network traffic for suspicious patterns and take action to block malicious activity.
An IDS analyzes network traffic in real-time, searching for known attack signatures or abnormal behavior. When it detects a potential ping attack, it can raise an alert or automatically trigger countermeasures to mitigate the attack. On the other hand, an IPS goes a step further by actively blocking or filtering malicious traffic, preventing it from reaching its intended target.
In addition to IDS and IPS, network monitoring tools can provide real-time insights into network performance and help identify anomalies indicative of a ping attack. These tools monitor various network parameters, such as bandwidth utilization, packet loss, and latency. By establishing baselines and comparing current network behavior against these baselines, network administrators can quickly identify any abnormal patterns that may indicate an ongoing ping attack.
Overall, by staying vigilant and utilizing the right network security tools, you can detect and respond to ping attacks effectively, minimizing their impact on your network infrastructure.
The best defense against ping attacks is a proactive approach that includes implementing preventive measures to strengthen your network security.
Ping attacks, also known as ICMP flood attacks, can overwhelm a network by flooding it with Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) echo request packets. These attacks can result in network congestion, decreased performance, and even network downtime. To protect your network from such attacks, it is crucial to take preventive measures.
Configuring your network in a secure manner can significantly reduce the risk of ping attacks. Implementing firewalls and access control lists (ACLs) can restrict ICMP traffic and prevent unauthorized devices from sending ping requests. By carefully defining rules and policies, you can control the flow of ICMP traffic and minimize the potential impact of ping attacks.
Furthermore, segmenting your network can limit the impact of an attack and prevent the lateral spread of threats. By dividing your network into smaller subnets, you can isolate different departments or devices, creating barriers that prevent an attack from affecting the entire network. This segmentation strategy enhances network security and makes it more challenging for attackers to exploit vulnerabilities.
Complementing your network configuration, deploying robust security software can further fortify your defenses against ping attacks. Antivirus programs, firewalls, and intrusion prevention systems should be regularly updated to ensure they can effectively identify and mitigate evolving threats.
Antivirus programs play a vital role in detecting and removing malware that may be used in conjunction with ping attacks. By scanning incoming and outgoing network traffic, these programs can identify malicious code and prevent it from infiltrating your network.
Firewalls act as a barrier between your internal network and the external world, monitoring and controlling network traffic based on predetermined security rules. They can be configured to block ICMP traffic or limit the number of ICMP packets allowed per second, effectively mitigating the impact of ping attacks.
Intrusion prevention systems (IPS) are designed to detect and prevent unauthorized access to your network. They analyze network traffic in real-time, looking for patterns and signatures associated with known attacks. By continuously monitoring network activity, IPS can identify and block ICMP flood attacks, ensuring the integrity and availability of your network.
Regularly updating your security software is essential to stay ahead of emerging threats. Cybercriminals are constantly developing new attack techniques, and by keeping your security software up to date, you can ensure that it is equipped to detect and mitigate the latest ping attack variants.
In the unfortunate event that your network becomes the target of a ping attack, a swift and effective response is crucial to mitigate its impact and prevent further damage.
A ping attack, also known as an ICMP flood attack, is a type of cyber attack where the attacker overwhelms a target network with a large number of Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) echo requests, commonly known as “pings.” These attacks can cause network congestion, slow down network performance, and potentially lead to service disruptions.
When faced with a ping attack, it is essential to act quickly. To minimize the damage, consider implementing traffic filtering measures to block the attack traffic. This can be done by configuring firewalls or intrusion prevention systems (IPS) to drop or rate-limit ICMP traffic. By selectively allowing only legitimate ICMP traffic, you can effectively mitigate the impact of the attack.
Additionally, consider informing your internet service provider (ISP) to assist in mitigating the attack at the network level. ISPs have the capability to filter and block attack traffic closer to its source, preventing it from reaching your network altogether. Collaborating with your ISP can significantly enhance your defense against ping attacks.
During a ping attack, it is crucial to gather as much information as possible about the attack. Monitor network traffic using network monitoring tools or intrusion detection systems (IDS) to identify the source IP addresses and the volume of attack traffic. This information can help you understand the scale of the attack and make informed decisions regarding mitigation strategies.
Furthermore, consider implementing rate-limiting measures to control the amount of ICMP traffic allowed into your network. By setting thresholds for the number of ICMP packets per second, you can prevent your network from being overwhelmed by the attack. However, it is essential to strike a balance between blocking attack traffic and allowing legitimate ICMP traffic to pass through.
Remember to document all relevant information about the attack, such as timestamps, IP addresses, and any observed patterns. This documentation will be valuable during the post-attack investigation and can aid in identifying the attackers and their motives.
Once the attack has been neutralized, it is important to conduct a thorough investigation to identify the source of the attack and any potential vulnerabilities that may have been exploited. Analyzing logs and network traffic captures can provide valuable insights into the attack vectors used and the techniques employed by the attackers.
Engage your network security team or a trusted cybersecurity professional to assist in the investigation. They can help analyze the attack data, identify any compromised systems, and recommend remediation steps to prevent similar attacks in the future.
In addition to investigating the attack, it is crucial to review and update your network security measures. Patch any known vulnerabilities in your network devices and applications to prevent attackers from exploiting them in future attacks. Regularly update your firewall rules and intrusion prevention systems to stay protected against evolving attack techniques.
Furthermore, consider implementing network segmentation to isolate critical systems from the rest of the network. By separating sensitive assets, such as servers and databases, from the general network, you can limit the potential impact of future attacks.
In conclusion, defending against ping (ICMP) attacks requires a combination of understanding their nature, implementing proactive preventive measures, and conducting thorough post-attack procedures. By staying vigilant, monitoring your network, and taking prompt action when necessary, you can greatly enhance your network security and protect against this common form of cyber threat.

Ping is a tool commonly used to find the status of a device on a network. Ping is based on theICMP protocol. When a Ping process request is sent out as an ICMP echo to the target device, it replies with an ICMP echo reply if the device is available.
Table of Contents
ping is used to send a test packet, or echo packet, to a device to find out whether it is reachable and how long the packet takes to reach the device. There are two important purposes.
Ping command is a simple way to check whether we have access to the particular host. But this method works only if ICMP and ping is enabled in that network. If ICMP is disabled, we can not get a proper response.

$ ping google.comPING google.com (172.217.194.139): 56 data bytes64 bytes from 172.217.194.139: icmp_seq=0 ttl=100 time=87.363 ms64 bytes from 172.217.194.139: icmp_seq=1 ttl=100 time=89.754 ms64 bytes from 172.217.194.139: icmp_seq=2 ttl=100 time=90.045 ms^C--- google.com ping statistics ---4 packets transmitted, 3 packets received, 25.0% packet lossround-trip min/avg/max/stddev = 87.363/89.054/90.045/1.202 ms
The ping command can also be used to check forpacket loss.When you run the ping command, it sends a series of packets to the specified destination and waits for a response.
If any of the packets are lost or do not receive a response, the ping command will report the percentage of packets lost.
For example, if you run the ping command and it reports “0% packet loss,” that means all of the packets that were sent were received successfully. However, if it reports “10% packet loss,” that means 10% of the packets that were sent did not receive a response and were lost.
So, the ping command is a useful tool forchecking network connectivity and identifying any packet loss issuesthat may be affecting your connection.
In some scenarios, we may want to use -s to increase the packet size from the default value of 64 bytes.
For example, to increase the packet size to 1000 bytes:
ping -s 1000 google.com
ICMP (Internet Control Message Protocol) is a protocol used by network devices, such as routers and hosts, to communicate error messages and operational information about the network.
It is an integral part of the Internet Protocol (IP) suite and is used by various network diagnostic tools such as ping, traceroute, and pathping.
ICMP messages are typically used for network troubleshooting and management, helping to identify and resolve issues related to network connectivity, packet loss, and latency.
In this part, we will explore ICMP in detail, including its message format, types, and examples of how it is used in practice.
ICMP is part of IP, and it relies on IP to transmit its messages. ICMP contains a relatively small header that changes depending on its purpose. The ICMP header contains the following fields:
Let’s see an example of ICMP packet.
00 0c 29 f8 1c 7c 00 0c 29 23 c1 05 08 00 45 0000 3c 02 04 00 00 80 01 6a 2e c0 a8 01 01 c0 a801 02 08 00 28 b6 7c 01 00 00 00 00 09 00 00 0000 00 00 00 00 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 1a1b 1c 1d 1e 1f 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 2a2b 2c 2d 2e 2f 30 31 32 33 34 35 36 37
This is a hexadecimal dump of the packet. ICMP packets are often used for diagnostic or error reporting purposes in networking.
In this example, the packet contains the following fields:
Each ICMP message has a specific type and code that determines its purpose.
The type field defines the general category of the ICMP message, while the code field provides additional information about the specific message type.
For example, an ICMP message with type 3 (Destination Unreachable) might have a code of 0 (Net Unreachable) or 1 (Host Unreachable) to further specify the reason for the error.
We can use thistcpdump commandto filter all ping packets. Here we use eth0 network interface in all our examples. Please change it based on the environment.
# tcpdump -i eth0 icmp
To filter ICMP echo-requests, we can use this tcpdump command.
# tcpdump -i eth0 ""icmp[0] == 8""
These are the packets we get captured with tcpdump command.
14:37:14.555295 IP 10.79.101.23 > 108.177.125.101: ICMP echo request, id 61205, seq 0, length 6414:37:15.557948 IP 10.79.101.23 > 108.177.125.101: ICMP echo request, id 61205, seq 1, length 6414:37:16.562905 IP 10.79.101.23 > 108.177.125.101: ICMP echo request, id 61205, seq 2, length 64
Here are 5 common ping command options with examples:
“-c” option: This option specifies the number of packets to send. For example, to send 5 packets, you can use the following command:
ping -c 5 google.com
“-i” option: This option sets the interval between successive packets. For example, to send packets at an interval of 3 second, you can use the following command:
ping -i 3 google.com
-w deadline: It specifys a timeout, in seconds, before ping exits regardless of how many packets have been sent or received. In this case ping does not stop after count packet are sent, it waits either for deadline expire or until count probes are answered or for some error notification from network.
The “-W” option in the ping command specifies the timeout in seconds for each packet sent. It sets the amount of time that the ping command waits for a response after sending each packet. If a response is not received within the specified timeout period, the packet is considered lost.
Here’s an example of using the “-W” option with a timeout of 5 seconds to ping google.com:
ping -W 5 google.com
In this example, the ping command will send packets to google.com and wait for a response for up to 5 seconds for each packet. If a response is not received within 5 seconds, the packet will be considered lost and the ping command will display a message indicating the packet loss. You can adjust the timeout period by changing the value after the “-W” option.
The following is the full list of options in ping command.

An ICMP flood attack, also known as a ping flood, is a type ofDenial of Service (DoS)attack. It overwhelms a system by sending a huge number of ICMP packets, specifically echo requests (pings).
This overwhelms the target’s network resources, preventing it from managing legitimate traffic and rendering the system unresponsive.
When attack traffic comes from many devices, it turns into aDDoS (Distributed Denial-of-Service) attack, which can cause even more severe damage.
ICMP flood DDoS attacks can significantly impact systems and networks, ranging from immediate slowdowns to broader effects that disrupt business operations and financial stability.
ICMP is an internet layer protocol network devices use to communicate and diagnose network communication issues.
In an ICMP flood attack, the attacker sends a massive number of ICMP echo requestpacketsto the target system. These packets are designed to produce an ICMP echo reply from the target.
The target system becomes overwhelmed by the sheer volume of incoming ICMP packets. Processing each request and sending a reply consumes CPU, memory, and network bandwidth, leading to degraded performance or complete unavailability.
ICMP ping flood attacks can be classified into three main types depending on the target and how the attacker’s IP address is resolved. Each type has distinct mechanisms and effects on network infrastructure.
In a Targeted Local Disclosed ICMP flood attack, the attacker aims at a specific computer within a local network. This type of attack requires the attacker to have prior knowledge of the target’s IP address.
For example, an attacker inside a corporate network targets a specific workstation or server by continuously sending ICMP echo requests, causing the system to become unresponsive and disrupting normal business operations.
In this type of DDoS attack, the attacker targets routers instead of individual computers. The goal is to disrupt the communication between computers on the network by overwhelming the router.
The attacker sends a high volume of ICMP echo request packets to the router’s IP address. Routers, being central to managing network traffic, can become overwhelmed by processing these packets, affecting their ability to route legitimate traffic efficiently.
Since routers are critical for directing traffic, their damage can lead to widespread network outages, affecting all connected devices.
Even if the router does not crash, the additional load can cause significant delays in packet forwarding, leading to increased latency for all network communications.
In severe cases, the router may crash or enter a fail-safe mode, resulting in a complete loss of network connectivity.
In a Blind Ping Flood attack, the attacker does not initially know the IP address of the target. Instead, they use external programs or techniques to discover the target’s IP address before launching the ICMP flood attack.
The attacker uses tools or services to scan for active IP addresses within a certain range or domain.
After identifying the target IP address, attackers generate a large volume of ICMP traffic to overwhelm the target’s network resources.
An ICMP flood attack and aPing of Deathattack are both types of Denial of Service (DoS) attacks leveraging the ICMP protocol, but they differ in their methods and objectives.
The Ping of Death attack exploits a specific vulnerability in older operating systems or network devices. It involves sending ICMP packets larger than the maximum allowed size (often 65,535 bytes), causing abuffer overflowand potentially crashing the target system’s network stack.
While both attacks can lead to service disruptions, the ICMP flood attack is more about sheer volume and resource exhaustion, whereas the Ping of Death attack targets vulnerabilities in packet handling, making mitigation strategies distinct for each.
While an ICMP flood attack directly targets a system with a high volume of ICMP echo requests, aSmurf attackamplifies the impact by exploiting IP broadcast addresses.
In a Smurf attack, the attacker sends ICMP echo requests to the broadcast address of a network with the spoofed IP address of the target. This causes all devices on the network to respond to the target IP, overwhelming it with the responses.
ICMP Flood andSYN Flood attacksare distinct in their approach and impact. While ICMP Flood attacks flood the target with ICMP echo request packets, SYN Flood attacks flood the target with TCP SYN packets, using spoofed IP addresses to initiate TCP connections.
The target allocates resources to respond with SYN-ACK packets but awaits an ACK packet to complete the three-way handshake. As the attacker fails to send the final ACK, the target’s resources are tied up in incomplete connections, leading to service unavailability for legitimate users.
To prevent ICMP flood attacks, a multi-layeredDDoS protectionapproach combining network configuration, monitoring, and security best practices is essential.
Start by configuring firewall rules to limit or block unnecessary ICMP traffic. Access your firewall’s management interface and create rules that deny inbound ICMP echo requests from untrusted sources and allow ICMP traffic only from known trusted IP addresses.
Next, implementrate limitingon routers and switches to control the number of ICMP packets allowed per second, preventing network overwhelm. Access your router or switch configuration, set rate limits for ICMP traffic, and monitor the impact, adjusting as needed.
Identify critical assets and segment your network using VLANs (Virtual Local Area Networks) to separate different parts of your network. Implement strict access controls between segments to limit ICMP traffic to necessary paths only.
Select an IPS solution, install and configure it according to the vendor’s guidelines, and ensure it is set to detect and block ICMP flood patterns. Keep the IPS signatures up-to-date to detect the latest attack methods.
Establish normal traffic baselines to identify anomalies and configure alerts for unusual spikes in ICMP traffic. Investigate alerts promptly and take action if an ICMP flood attack is detected.
Regularly conduct security audits and updates to maintain effective network and firewall configurations. Keep all network devices, firewalls, and software current with the latest security patches. Periodically review security policies to ensure they align with the latest threats and industry best practices.
LeverageDDoS mitigation solutionslike AppTrana WAAP, which act as a shield against all types of DDoS attacks, ensuring the target system remains available and performs optimally.
These tools continuously monitor incoming traffic for patterns indicative of an attack. When abnormal traffic patterns are detected, the service filters out malicious traffic before it reaches the target network.
Conduct training sessions to educate IT staff about ICMP flood attacks and prevention techniques. Develop and practice incident response plans for handling ICMP flood attacks and keep staff informed about the latest security trends and threats.

https://www.firewall.cx/networking/network-protocols/icmp-protocol/icmp-echo-ping.html,"As mentioned in the previous page, anEchois simply what we networking engineers call a 'ping'. TheEcho Replyis, as most would guess,  the 'ping reply'. ICMP Echos are used mostly for troubleshooting. When there are 2 hosts which have communication problems, a few simple ICMP Echo requests will show if the 2 hosts have their TCP/IP stacks configured correctly and if there are any problems with the routes packets are taking in order to get to the other side.
The 'ping' command is very well known, but the results of it are very often misunderstood and for that reason I have chosen to explain all those other parameters next to the ping reply, but we will have a look at that later on.
Let's have a look at what an ICMP-Echo or Echo Reply packet looks like:
If the above packet was an ICMP Echo (ping), then the Type field takes a value of 8. If it's an ICMP Echo Reply (ping reply) then it would take a value of 1.
The screenshot below shows a simple ping and analyzes the information/output:
Okay, now looking at the screen shot above, you can see I pinged www.firewall.cx. The first thing my workstation did was to resolve that URL to an IP address. This was performed usingDNS. Once the DNS server returned the IP address of www.firewall.cx, the workstation generated an ICMP packet with theType fieldset to8.
Here is the proof:
The picture above is a screenshot from my packet sniffer the same time this experement was taking place. The packet displayed is one of the 4 packets which were sent from my workstation to the webserver of firewall.cx
Notice theICMP type=8 Echofield right under theICMP Header section. This clearly shows that this packet is being sent from the workstation and not received. If it was received, it would have been an 'Echo Reply' and have a value of0.
The next weird thing, if anyone noticed, is the data field. Look at the screen shot from command prompt above and notice the value there and the value the packet sniffer is showing on the left. One says 32 Bytes, and the other 40 Bytes !
The reason for this is that the packet sniffer is taking into account the ICMP header files (ICMP type, code, checksum and identifier), and I'll prove it to you right now.
Look at the top of this page where we analysed the ICMP headers , you will notice that the lengths (in Bits) of the various fields are as follows: 8, 8, 16, 16, 16. These add up to a total of 64 Bits. Now 8 Bits = 1 Byte, therefore 64 Bits = 8 Bytes. Take the 32 Bytes of data the workstation's command prompt is showing and add 8 Bytes .... and you have 40 Bytes in total. To view the full screen image shot of the packet sniffer, pleaseclick here.
And that just about does it for these two ICMP messages!

https://notes.networklessons.com/icmp-mitigating-vulnerabilities,"TheICMPprotocol is a useful supporting protocol that is used by network devices to exchange operational information and error messages.  ICMP does havevulnerabilitiesthat can be exploited by malicious attackers.  However, there are certain strategies that can be used to mitigate against these vulnerabilities.
Arguably the most effective strategy (and simplest to employ) is to disable responses to ICMP completely on network devices, such as routers or switches. You will often see this approach on routers that are found on the Internet. If you have done aTracerouteto a destination on the Internet, you may see that some hops along the way don’t respond. This is because they have been configured not to respond to ICMP messages for security reasons.
Now this solution is not always preferable because you may want to have utilities such aspingand traceroute available for troubleshooting.  Or you may have services and mechanisms in place that use ICMP, like certain monitoring tools, or PathMTUDiscovery (PMTUD), that will not function if you disable responses to ICMP.
There are two primary approaches:
If you choose to disable ICMP completely, then you must use other methods to troubleshoot. This can include using tools like:
The other approach is to not disable ICMP but to implement strategies that will help mitigate the risks associated with ICMP while still maintaining its benefits. This approach can include:
There is no single best solution for all cases, it should be examined on a case by case basis. Disabling ICMP completely is easiest, but if you need ping and traceroute for troubleshooting (as well as for other possible features) then the alternative is to mitigate any such attacks as described above.

A Ping of Death in cyber security is a type of denial of service (DoS) attack that involves sending a malformed or oversized ICMP packet to a target system.When the target system tries to reassemble the packet, it can cause various issues, potentially leading to system crashes, reboots, or general instability.
The ICMP, short form for Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP),is used by network devices, like routers, to send error messages and operational information. One common use of ICMP is the ""ping"" command, which tests the connectivity between two network devices by sending ICMP Echo Request packets and waiting for Echo Reply packets.
In late 1996, security researchers identified a critical flaw in how many operating systems and network devices handled oversized ICMP packets. The standard maximum size for an IP packet is 65,535 bytes. If an ICMP packet exceeds this size, it must be fragmented into smaller packets to traverse the network and then reassembled by the receiving system.
Researchers found that if an attacker sent an ICMP Echo Request packet larger than the maximum size, many systems would mishandle the reassembly process. This could lead to buffer overflows, causing system crashes, reboots, or other unpredictable behaviours.
Here’s how the Ping of Death attack works:
When a system receives an oversized ICMP packet:
Modern operating systems and network devices are generally patched to handle oversized or malformed packets effectively. Additionally, firewalls can be configured to identify and block suspicious fragmentation patterns. However, a ping of DeathDDoS attackcan still be a threat to unpatched systems or those with lax security measures.
Recent incidents of Ping of Death include the discovery of the vulnerability affecting IPv6 networks. This vulnerability allowed attackers to send oversized ping packets, causing systems to crash or reboot.
Another notable example was a vulnerability in Windows 10 and Windows Server 2019, which was patched by Microsoft in 2020. Therefore, one must remember that attackers are constantly innovating, so staying vigilant with security practices is crucial.
Preventing Ping of Death attacks requires a layered approach that involves both network configuration and software protection.
Ping of Death attacks, once a major threat, are largely mitigated by modern systems. However, complacency can be dangerous. Unpatched systems and lax security measures leave them susceptible to these DoS attacks. By employing a layered defence that includes system updates, robust firewall configurations, network monitoring, and intrusion detection, organizations can stay ahead of attackers and ensure continued network uptime.

https://www.itsecuritydemand.com/insights/security/menace-of-ping-flood-attacks-a-growing-network-peril/,"The rapid data transmission across interconnected networks demands superior network stability and uncompromised security. However, in the realm of cyberspace lies numerous deceptive threats, of whichping flood attackcan be named one. The content presented gradually discusses its vicious functioning, malicious kinds, paralyzing impact, and, thus, curateddetection and prevention strategies.
A ping flood, commonly referred to as an ICMP flood, constitutes a form ofdistributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attackwherein the malicious actor inundates the designated device or network with a relentless stream of request packets (pings). Such an onslaught can lead to network congestion and impede legitimate users’ access to network resources.
Understanding the intricate functioning ofping flood DDoS attackshelps to comprehend their disruptive potential in network security.
The Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP), integral to ping flood, serves as an Internet layer protocol facilitating communication among network devices. Diagnostic tools like traceroute and ping rely on ICMP for operation. Typically, ICMP echo-request and echo-reply messages are employed to ping a network device, assessing its health and connectivity, as well as the connection between the sender and the device.
Each ICMP request necessitates server resources to process and respond, along with bandwidth for both the incoming echo-request and outgoing echo-reply messages. TheDDoS ping flood attackseeks to overwhelm the targeted device’s capacity to handle the influx of requests and/or saturate the network connection with spurious traffic. By mobilizing numerous devices in a botnet to target the same internet property or infrastructure component with ICMP requests, the attack traffic escalates significantly, potentially disrupting normalnetwork operations.
Historically, attackers often employed IP spoofing to obscure the attack’s origin. However, modern botnet attacks seldom employ IP masking, relying instead on an extensive network of un-spoofed bots to inundate a target’s resources.
Various attack strategies unleash a barrage of network traffic, flooding systems with data packets and disrupting communication channels.
A diverse array of ICMP attacks presents formidable challenges to network defense mechanisms.
This form of attack aims at routers to disrupt communication and collaboration among computers within a network. Attackers possess the internal IP address of the local router or switch.
Such aping flood attack exampletargets a particular computer within a localnetwork architecture, utilizing the precise IP address of the victim device.
Before initiating the attack, an external program is deployed to uncover the IP address of the target computer router.
Another seemingly innocuousvariation of a ping flood attack, when wielded by malicious actors, has the power to unleash chaos and disruption on unsuspecting systems.
This peculiar kind of attack enables threat actors to dispatch malformed or excessively large ICMP packets, surpassing the maximum IPv4 packet size of 65,535 bytes. This action leads to the crash or freezing of the target system as it grapples with processing the oversized packets.
Although most contemporaryoperating systemsare no longer susceptible toPing of Death attacks, a sizable ping flood employing standard-sized packets can still effectively execute a denial-of-service.
Speaking of consequences, the relentless onslaughts can overwhelm the target’s resources, rendering it unable to respond to legitimate traffic, thereby disrupting services and causing significant downtime.
The impact of ICMP attacks reverberates within the extent of network communication, posing potential vulnerabilities tonetwork and infrastructure management.
The deluge of ICMP packets absorbs a significant portion of the CPU cycles of routers, firewalls, and servers. This overload on the CPU leads to widespread performance degradation or even complete system crashes. Additionally, attempting to process the traffic ofICMP ping flood attackscan deplete available memory resources.
The immense amount of ICMP echo requests overwhelms the inbound bandwidth of the network, rendering it inaccessible for genuine users to reach network resources. Consequently, web servers, email servers, and other publicly accessible systems become inaccessible.
All services hosted on the flooded device or within the affected network segment become inaccessible due to network saturation. Websites experience timeouts,cloud-managed servicesare obstructed, and network-dependent applications cease to function correctly.
As network infrastructures become more interconnected, the threat posed by these malicious floods of ICMP packets looms larger, demanding robust combating strategies.
Devising robust mitigation strategies is paramount to combat the sophisticated nature of ICMP attacks.
Implementing this remedial measure helps regulate the quantity of ICMP echo request messages received by your network, thereby diminishing the impact ofping flood attack command.
Employing traffic filtering rules aids in the detection and obstruction of harmful ICMP traffic while permitting legitimate requests to transit uninterrupted.
Anomaly detectionsystems monitor patterns of network traffic, flagging any irregularities such as sudden spikes in ICMP traffic, which could indicate the presence of activeICMP attacks and ping floods.
Network administrators have the option to deactivate the ICMP functionality of a targeted device by configuring a firewall to restrict the device’s capability to send and receive any requests via ICMP.
Specialized anti-DDoS solutionsprevent ping flood attacksand several other forms of DDoS risks by screening out malicious traffic prior to its arrival at the targeted system.
Routers and firewalls can recognize established DDoS botnets via IP blackhole lists, promptly discarding traffic originating from them. While this practice diminishesvolumetric DDoS attacks, it may prove less effective against botnets that frequently change their IP addresses.
Ping flood attackspose a significant threat to network stability and security by burgeoning target systems with ICMP echo requests. While variations like thePing of Death attackexploit vulnerabilities in packet sizes, the core aim remains disruption. Best practices and strategies such as traffic filtering, anomaly detection, and anti-DDoS solutions are crucial for mitigation. However, vigilance is essential as attackers evolve tactics.
Understanding these attacks and their working principles, types, and defense strategies is vital for safeguarding networks against potential threats.
